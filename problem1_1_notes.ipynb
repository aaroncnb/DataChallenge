There's a lot of data attrributes (# of columns), which could be useful, but could also overcomplicate the analysis. Even if every columns helps improve our analysis, we'll still have to make sure the data take a form that our modeling efforts can use. I.e. how do you feed \"basic.6y\" into even a simple statistical test? With all the mixed numeric and string data, it'll be hard to even visualize. \n",

Ultimately we will want all of the data we deem useful to be part of the same algorithm.\n",

A good example from scikit learn's documentations shows a variance filter of 0.8, so let's use that for the moment."

We want to get a simple-working model up and running as soon as possible, so let's just keep one of these metrics for the moment. It's entirely possible that we might need all 3 metrics for fine tuning, but best not to overcomplicates things from the get-go.\n",

While they are all \"quaterly\" average measures, according to the instructions, only one of them gives a daily running average, and that's the 'euribor' which seems to be a measure of interest rates. Perhaps this daily variation will tell us more about the specific conditions for each caller. Admiddetly, this is a rather arbitrary choice, but we the point is to simplify the dataset while we develop a strategy.\n",

    "So those were fairly straightforward, since months and days of the week have an obvious order to them. Some other attributes are also fairly simple, as in marital status which has only two possible values; we can binarize it. But what do we do with things like \"job\" and \"education\"? We'll have to be a bit more arbitrary about it, if we want to do any numerical analysis or apply vectorized routines to speed things up. At least Education has a kind of chronology to it- high-school before university, and so on. If we enforce an order on something like \"job\" though, we're implicitly making assumptions about its correlation with other data. If we order \"services\" before \"blue-color\", then we're letting our bias about which jobs pay better, enter into the process. Conflating income level with \"job\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, there are several columns which, despite taking numeric values, are rather opaque. It seemed safe enough to go ahead and assume \"month\" means month, but let's take a deeper look at the explanations given in the online archive for the other columns. The most glaring issue is that it's not apparent which column indicates the outcome of each call. The last column looks like the best bet, but let's have a quick read to be sure."

While they seem to tell us that there is an overall trend with age, and retirement, and housemaids to say \"yes\" to the bank, the age distribution below tells us that there are very few participants over age 60. So while it may be accurate to say that, within those over 60, there is a trend to say yes- there is likely not a significant trend in this data for those who say yes to be over 60. We can't rule out a samping bias, but we do have to be careful about density plots. The reason for the confusion is that, for each side of the violin plots, the area is normalized to that category. So it falseley represents the groups is being roughly equal."

Not only that, but the simple fact that someone indicated they'd like to make a loan, does not mean that this person is a good candidate for a loan. There may be a more informative hybrid parameter in here somewhere, a combination of the given data that traces a more relevant parameter than simply job or education. I.e., probably one of the most interesting data we might want, but glaringly absent: income, or better yet, income-to-debt-ratio. Or thinking a bit further: liklihood that a given group has had, or expects, a life event that might necessitate a loan. We are not given this data directly, but the collection of our data may be tracing factors. \n",

People with a certain job? Some other incredibly specific set of life circumstances? I prefer to first attempt an unsupervised approach. In this way we are forced to consider structure of the data as we go along, rather than building a black box.

Mathematically, call these low (or zero) variance features. Sklearn provides a convenient class for filtering by variance, in the Feature Selection module."
